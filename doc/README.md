 ## Description

The goal of the project is to create a social network where users can add each other as friends and share posts.


## What is LoungeY
An attempt to redefine the user perception of a normal web interaction. 
In a time of constant sollicitation, notification and pervasive ads, we set to understand the real need of social interaction on the web. 
We scoped this need to the following actions:
	
	1. Have a *profile*
	2. Have a list of *friends*
		2.1 Get notified of new friends
	3. Post an idea/question
		3.1 to the world
		3.2 to our friends
	4. Comment on an idea/question
	5. See ideas/questions of others
		3.1 public
		3.2 only friends
	5. Full search on Posts
		5.1 Use of Hashtags to discriminate

Moreover, the main idea is of the community: we don't search to connect everybody without discrimination -this proving to be a seemly bad idea, as per Facebook social impact tend to prove-, the service will be reserved to the students at HEIG-VD

The main result is lacking some of thoses features as is (see below), but only as far as the frontend. We serve a fully functional REST API and the databases accessgoing with it. 
## What tech are we using ?

###DB: MongoDB 
	hosted on mLab.i

###back-end: Spring Boot.
	
###front-end: React.js
	We also used specially: 
	1. React-Router
	2. universal-cookie
	3. material-ui
	
	We also made extensive use of ES6 scripture, syntax an promise.
