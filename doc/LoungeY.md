## Issue

After years and years of improvements in our so orange school, we happend to still lack efficients way of meeting, coaching and interacting with others students; the basis of a successful and fulfilling life and the production of good little workers. 

The ChillOut is an attempt at solving this problem through the access to a beer-filled, couch-packed place with many opportunities to have fun and/or work with others. But the reality is harsh and unforgiving, for the beer is not always readily accessible and the others sometimes busy when we're not -be it for a classe or for any outdoor activity, like gardening. 



## Proposition

Given the ease with which social network have ~~infested~~ made themselves fundamental in our lives, we think we can apply the general ideas they contains to create a **private** network of students and member of the professoral college. 
People will be able to create an account with their heig-vd.ch  email account and enjoy many way of interacting with others. 

The main point are as follow: 

+ Personal Wall and Profile
+ Posts / Questions - Comments / Responses
+ Beer showroom  (*optional*)
